# Let  Everything be Continuous

Before the rise of agile methodologies in software development, organisations used the traditional software development processes also referred to as the Waterfall or Sequential models, which is a step-by-step process where one phase must be completed before moving to the next phase.

Phases of Traditional Software Development Process

The traditional software development phase typically involves the following Phases.

Requirement Gathering:

The requirement-gathering phase objective is to create a detailed understanding of what the goal the software aims to achieve. This covers the software requirements, functionalities, user expectations and other dependencies.

System Design:

This phase relies on the requirements gathered to design the plan and software architecture, this covers how each component of the software will interact with each other, system diagrams and high-level design documents.

Implementation

In this phase, developers write actual code using the appropriate programming language to implement the design, i.e. writing an executable code.

Testing:

To ensure that the application meets the stated objectives, the testing phase begins which include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing, to discover and rectify defect and fix bugs.

Integration:

In this phase, individual components are integrated into a complete system making sure that they work and interact with each other as expected.

Deployement:

After integration, the software is deployed to the production environment. This phase includes processes such as installation, configuration and data migration.

Maitenance and Support:

The software development lifecycle does not end at deployment, now and then, some new features will need to be added, bugs fixed and so on, so there is the need to maintain the software and provide support to end users.

Limitations

The traditional software development process came with some limitations which made it difficult for developers to deliver reliable software to end users, some of these Limitations are:

Sequential Flow:

In the traditional development process, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin, so any delay encountered in a phase will affect the subsequent phase. This usually results in late delivery of the product.

Document-Driven:

The traditional development process relies highly on extensive documentation which results in the development and design team focusing too much on documentation instead of building software that meets users' expectations.

Long Development Cycles:

Because each phase needs to be completed before the next one begins, traditional development processes often have longer development cycles and any feature or update to add must go through this whole process.

Late Feedback:

Testing and user feedback typically occur late in the process, making it more challenging to address issues and changes.

Rigid Scope: Before implementation begins, all software features and functionalities are designed, because of this any addition of features, changes to requirements or design after the project starts can be difficult to implement, potentially leading to delays and increased costs.

Risky Delivery:

Software is delivered only at the end of the development process which takes a long period, there is a risk that at the end of the development cycle, it might not meet user needs or expectations or these expectations might change.

DevOps 

To promote agility, efficiency, and a customer-centric focus in software development, many organisations have moved to DevOps, unlike the traditional software development process, where departments work in siloed, DevOps bridge the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It focuses on improving collaboration and communication between these two traditionally separate teams to enable faster and more reliable software development and delivery.

Key Principles of DevOps:

Collaboration:

DevOps encourages close collaboration between development, operations, and other teams involved in the software lifecycle. Communication and cooperation are essential to break down silos and ensure a smooth flow of work.

Automation:

Automation is at the core of DevOps. Manual and repetitive tasks are automated to improve efficiency and reduce human error. This includes automating build, deployment, testing, and infrastructure provisioning processes.

Continuous Integration (CI):

CI involves frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository. Automated build and test processes are triggered whenever code is pushed, helping to catch integration issues early and maintain a consistent codebase.

Continuous Delivery (CD):

CD extends CI by automatically deploying code changes to production or staging environments after passing automated tests. This enables faster and more reliable software delivery to end-users.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

IaC involves managing and provisioning infrastructure using code and automation tools. This approach ensures consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployments and reduces configuration drift.

Monitoring and Feedback:

Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure provides valuable insights into performance, availability, and user experience. Feedback from monitoring helps teams identify issues and make informed decisions for improvements.

Microservices and Containerization:

DevOps often leverages microservices architecture and containerization (e.g., Docker) to create modular and scalable applications that are easier to manage and deploy.
